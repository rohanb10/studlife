<br> <h4>(1) Fall 2015 WILD vs. (4) Lizzy Crist</h4>
<p> OK, going to be totally honest here: we cheated in this matchup a little bit.<a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Rule #2—There are no rules.">

<p>You see, Lizzy Crist is baller and amazing and the hero Wash. U. deserves but just not the one it needs.</p>

<p>Fall 2015 WILD, on the other hand, has a chip on its shoulder. If fall WILD was in a Greek organization, it would have reached the end of its lineage this year, thanks to the powers that be. </p>

</a> Well, imagine you are Liam Neeson in the first “Taken.” Your daughter has just been kidnapped, likely been murdered and is probably never coming back. You have two options. 1) Sit there and cry because honestly, that’s totally valid and a completely normal response.<a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="I'm in Uncle Joe's.">

<p>Basically, we looked ahead in the bracket, saw the possibility of Kenneth vs. Fall 2015 WILD and cried one solitary tear of happiness. </p>

<p>Fall 2015 WILD is Liam Neeson. Lizzy Crist is Liam Neeson’s tear ducts. She’s irrelevant to his process of vengeance and just an obstacle he doesn’t have time to deal with. 
So, sorry Lizzy, but fall 2015 WILD takes this round easy.<em>—Wesley Jenkins</em></p>

<br> <h4>(6) Demetri Kavadas vs. (7) Kenneth Sng</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, this isn’t the first time these two have gone <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/student-union/2016/03/07/false-rumors-swirl-as-student-union-presidential-race-heats-up/" target="_blank">head-to-head(-to head).</a><a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some context: Mike Holtz was there last time—in that he also ran for SU President.

	<sup class="sup-small sup-smaller">

<p>As we all know, he succeeded. But what I hope you gleaned from that rambling graf was that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Backpack Guy did indeed run for SU president. Did he have a real platform? Not really. Did he have any SU experience? Nope. Did he think he was going to win? He claims not. But, despite being at Wash. U. for less than a year, he still ran.</p>

<p>If you didn’t know who Demetri was before (I don’t understand how this could be possible, but maybe you just spend all your time in Olin Library and have never experienced joy), this election showed you the wonders of how his music-toting backpack makes everyone feel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Demetri, he’s going up against Kenneth here. Our beloved Kenneth. And if we’re sticking by the rules—Kenneth won.<em>—Noa Yadidi</em></p>

<br> <h4>(1) Presidential Debate vs. (4) Safety </h4>
<p>So our homie Obama never came to campus because we had a <a href="http://www.studlife.com/archives/News/2007/11/28/WashingtonUniversityacceptsbidforVicePresidentialdebate/" target="_blank">vice presidential debate in 2008,</a> and in 2012, our campus was about as relevant as Mitt Romney’s internal polling (he really, truly thought he was going to win).</p>
 
<p>Can we make up for it with the debate-to-end-all-debates this time around?</p>
 
<p>To be honest, probably not. Obama is a pretty cool dude whereas <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump+oompa+loompa&espv=2&biw=1165&bih=856&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDrK39zMPMAhXILSYKHaoADfcQsAQIGw" target="_blank">Trump most closely resembles an Oompa Loopa</a> crossed with an unhusked ear of corn, Bernie is a (slightly) younger and angrier version of my grandpa and Hillary’s about as interesting as an 8 a.m. lecture.</p>

	</div>
 
<p>But that’s OK. The presidential debate might even increase our poorly named University’s national profile. There’ll be some prominent journalists and political pundits here, which I think is pretty cool.</p>

<p>You know what’s not cool? <a href="http://www.studlife.com/forum/staff-editorials/2016/04/21/university-emergency-alerts-leave-students-confused-and-underprepared/" target="_blank">The Wash. U. emergency notification protocol.</a> </p>

<p>As we all found out (or didn’t find out, as students in Seigle Hall can attest) during the recent campus lockdown, <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/national-news/2016/04/21/lack-of-information-leads-to-campus-wide-confusion/" target="_blank">no one really knows what to do in case of an emergency.</a> Teachers kept teaching—or didn’t—students went to a safe space (if they could figure out what that meant) and confirmed information eluded our collective minds for nearly an hour and a half.</p> 

<p>While the campus has worked diligently to become a safer place for students (re: It’s On Us), our <a href="http://www.studlife.com/forum/staff-editorials/2016/04/03/in-case-of-emergency-we-need-more-than-notifications/" target="_blank"> emergency protocol</a> proves that there’s still work to be done.</p>
 
<p>Maybe all the debate actually means for us is infinitely less pregames and infinitely more complaining about how WILD is so great because “only like 200 students will be able to go to this f---ing debate and not everyone even cares about politics, but like doesn't basically everyone with a pulse go to WILD? Or at least attempt to go to WILD???” (This could or could not be better than complaints about the WILD artist—I haven’t decided yet.)</p>
 
<p>But you know, if the biggest complaint is that not everyone can go to the debate, that’s far more reassuring than having to ask “what the hell do I do in a more serious situation?”</p>
 
<p>The debate lives to see another day.<em> —Ella Chochrek</em></p>

<br> <h4>(6) SU v SPB vs. (7) Adjuncts</h4>
<p>SU and SPB are like smooth and crunchy peanut butter, respectively. SU is the model of homogeneity, each member conforming to creed and making decisions for the student body as such. SPB, on the other hand, is a bit rougher around the edges. Yeah, they basically do the same thing, but they aren’t afraid to speak their mind when need be. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/comments/33jo05/i_accidentally_got_crunchy_peanut_butter_instead/" target="_blank">In most smooth vs. crunchy peanut butter debates,</a> smooth takes the cake...erm—sandwich. </p>

<p>That’s why it was so surprising when the bad boys, the rebels, those who speak their mind and stand up to say no, took the win. Students (mostly) rallied behind SPB to call for more transparency and less vanilla “this is the way it’s been” from SU, wanting the group to use our student activities fees the right way. It was a fight for the ages, and somehow the underdog won.</p>

	</div>

<p>Speaking of underdogs winning, Wash. U.’s adjuncts did just the same. After a yearlong fight, the University agreed to negotiate with the adjuncts for a more livable wage. It was the culmination of efforts by many groups, resulting in a better situation for a lot of people. But alas, the adjuncts will still lose this round. </p>

<p>You see, the adjuncts are the bread to the student groups’ peanut butter. While it’s great and all that adjunct professors can now make a living wage, Wash. U. is—at heart—for the students.  And SU vs. SPB put the student issues right at the forefront, regardless of how childish the methods were. No one comes to college to eat just bread; you need some peanut butter—whether crunchy or not—to build a fulfilling (and filling) experience. <em>—Wesley Jenkins</em></p>

<br> <h4>(6) College Activism vs. (2) Women’s Soccer</h4>

<p>At universities across the country, students fought for causes they believe in: higher wages and increased job security for adjunct faculty, racial equality, an end to sexual assault—the list goes on. On our own fair campus, students also used their voices, standing up for causes they believe in such as the Black Lives Matter movement, more women’s representation in the physics department and better pay for adjunct professors. So, that’s great—Wash. U. students are making their voices heard. </p>

	</div>

<p>But other college students across the country can say that their voices were heard and that they fought for causes they believed in just as well as we can, whereas non-Wash. U. students can’t say that their Division III women’s soccer team beat out the No. 1-ranked seed in the semifinals in penalty kicks to make it to the national championship. </p>

<p>I’m quick to acknowledge that our student body is apathetic about sports, but come on, even if you don’t care at all about Division III sports you’ve got to admit that the women’s soccer team is amazing. So, yeah. Women’s soccer (and any chance of the Wash. U. student body actually giving a s--- about the Bears) moves on. <em>—Ella Chochrek</em></p>

<br><h4>(8) Zach Alter vs. (4) Rugby going D1</h4>
<p>This matchup comes down to a numbers game. But not a numbers-of-people game because Rugby wins that matchup really easily. Zach is, after all, just one young boy.</p>

<p>Rather, this matchup comes down to a numbers-of-accomplishments game, in which Zach narrowly edges out our rough-and-tumble friends. Not only has Zach created a new academic track, but he also has performed at WUStock and opened for CHERUB at SPB’s Spring Concert. Or, I guess I should say, DJ Alter performed at those events.</p>

<p>While both are successful in their own way, Zach wins this matchup because his success is more unique. Zach is a beautiful unicorn, a five-leaf clover, a picture of Chancellor Wrighton wearing sweatpants. To put it in terms of pop culture: Zach is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE" target="_blank">Isaiah Mustafa seamlessly transitioning from a boat to a horse in the Old Spice commercials</a> or the college student embodiment of the Dos Equis Most Interesting Man in the World. </p>

<br><h4>(3) Women on Campus vs. (2) Gamma Phi Beta</h4>
<p>So Gamma Phi Beta immediately made a splash before they even arrived on campus this winter because of endless promotions, including flyers in the bathroom stalls in Simon Hall’s basement (like come on—isn’t that supposed to be a private space?) and free vanilla-scented lip balms. </p> 
 
<p>I’m still not really sure if GPB is srat, but I’m not exactly waiting with bated breath to find out. After all, isn’t it sort of bad that Wash. U. students feel a need to define others by organizations they belong to? (I get it, everyone on StudLife is really, really weird, and I should’ve just joined a different club when I had the chance, goddamn it.) That said, putting people into a box is kind of, sort of, maybe, wrong—no?</p>

<div class="text-xs-center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Welcome to campus, Gamma Phi Beta! We can&#39;t wait to assign a new, arbitrary stereotype to 100+ women.</p>&mdash; Fake Wrighton (@ChancellorW) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChancellorW/status/595690952783695873">May 5, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>Women on Campus have achieved a lot without being boxed in. And yeah, maybe there was no groundbreaking movement a la Inez Milholland at Vassar College in the very early 1900s (I’m aware that this is an obscure reference—look her up!). But progress has been made. And you know what’s part of that progress? The colonizing of Gamma Phi Beta.</p>
 
<p>So, sorry GPB—I don’t want to categorize you into some stupid box like I’ve done with every other Greek organization at Wash. U. I mean, in all fairness, I probably will do it eventually, but I’ll give you a little more time to remain relatively anonymous while your members come up with a stereotype for you. In the meantime, I’ll focus instead on what women as a whole can achieve at Wash. U. Bye bye, Gamma Phi.<em>—Ella Chochrek</em></p>
