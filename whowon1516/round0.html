	<p>I’ve been pulled over four times in my driving career. Of those four times, only one has resulted in a ticket, but that’s uninteresting because you’re supposed to get a ticket when you’re pulled over.</p>

	<p>The most recent time I was pulled over without getting a ticket, I was turning left onto Clayton Road by the AMC Esquire 7, and I cut the wheels a bit too early and ended up going the wrong way. Given that it was a Saturday night around midnight, I was pulled over immediately. Convinced I was driving drunk (I wasn’t, I’m just stupid), the policeman had me perform field sobriety tests for half an hour before lecturing me and sending me on my merry way. Again, I’m just stupid.</p>

	<p>All of which to say, the Washington University school year spanning the years of 2015 and 2016 has felt a bit like driving the wrong way at midnight on a Saturday and then doing half an hour of field sobriety tests while sober. Meaning: it’s been a clusterf---.</p>

	<p>From protests to mishaps, tiffs to full-on conflicts, no WILD to a presidential debate, this year has seen it all. That’s not to say there hasn’t been some good; it’s just been overshadowed by the massive pile of s--- that just keeps growing.</p>

	<p>Before the eternal shuttering of its digital doors, the esoteric sports and culture blog <a href="http://grantland.com" target="_blank">Grantland</a> produced a year-in-review bracket to determine “Who Won [insert year here]?” As most of our <a href="http://studlife.com/staff" target="_blank">staff</a> can be characterized as overzealous Grantland fanboys and girls, we decided to give it a shot.</p>

	<p>The rules are mostly the same—four categories, 32 contestants, one winner—but some tweaks had to be made. 1) We are all students with other lives to live so this bracket does not reflect one dicta—ahem—person’s opinion. Rather, it is a compilation of various staffers’ takes. 2) Rules are for losers; we mostly made it up as we went.</p>

	<p>There are eight entrants from each of the four categories: a list that was narrowed down after a strenuous process consisting mostly of desperately trying to come up with 32 things that happened this year. But we did it. And here they are.</p>

	<div class="cat-list ">
		<p>1. People</p>
		<p>2. Movements</p>
		<p>3. Entertainment</p>
		<p>4. New Additions</p>
	</div>

	<p>Those are your categories. Take a long hard look because after this sentence, they are completely irrelevant.</p>

	<p><strong>The Perennial:</strong> You can’t win the year if you do the same thing every single year. That’s like if the Golden State Warriors just stayed this good for the rest of eternity and won every single NBA championship ever. It’d be cool for a year or two, but then everyone would just be bored. Sorry <a href="http://www.studlife.com/scene/2015/03/23/better-know-an-admin-mr-chancellor-goes-to-steak-n-shake/" target="_blank">Chancellor Mark Wrighton</a>. Sorry <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2015/10/26/holden-thorp-provost-leads-wu-toward-greater-economic-diversity/" target="_blank">Provost Holden Thorp</a>.</p>

	</div>

	<p><strong>The Departed:</strong> You can’t win if you’re not there. Rembert Browne established this in the <a href="http://grantland.com/features/who-won-2011/" target="_blank">inaugural Grantland bracket</a>. You may have a had a pretty damn good year, but if you were absent at the end of it, it’s going to be a net negative. So if you hit the road, you’re not in the bracket.</p>

	<p><strong>The Seedings:</strong> As with Rembert’s brackets, these seedings are objectively subjective. That means we as a staff picked who was going to be in the bracket, then outsourced the duties of seeding them to someone else. Who, you may ask? Why the only group on campus that is more reliable, more respected and knows more than us at Student Life. The tour guides!</p>

	<p>We sampled a group of tour guides, asking them to rank each of our 32 entries from most likely to least likely to be mentioned on a tour. Yes, no self-respecting tour guide would mention half of these things on any tour, but that’s not the point of the game.</p>

	<p>Basically what this boils down is a displacement of blame. Mad that Anderson .Paak didn’t make the bracket? Go ahead and make angry posts on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wesley.jenkins.56" target="_blank">my Facebook wall</a>. Mad that Anderson .Paak is an eighth seed? Go berate your local tour guide because I don’t want to hear it.</p>

	<p>Now onto the fun stuff.</p>

	<p><strong>The Mentions:</strong> We wrote these down, sometimes because we were humoring someone’s bad idea, sometimes because they sounded funny, sometimes because it was 4 a.m., and we didn’t know any better.</p>

	<p><strong>The Case against <a href="http://www.studlife.com/scene/2016/01/27/rip-to-the-vip/" target="_blank">Harry’s closing</a>:</strong> Harry’s Restaurant &amp; Bar was dear to us all. Harry’s was the lifeblood that kept the off-campus Wash. U. social life bumping. Harry’s was the learning curve that separated the good fakes from the bad. Harry’s was also a s---hole that needed to die.</p>

	<p>One last matter of business before we get to the actual matchups: the regions. Ever since 1976, when the trustees added “in St. Louis” to our name, high school seniors have been forced to choose between the official mouthful that is our University name or suffer in silence as friends, relatives and countrymen misplace the location of their undergraduate studies. To honor that new crop of seniors, each region will be named after the beginning of an oh-so-uncomfortable conversation: “is it in <a href="http://www.washington.edu" target="_blank">Seattle</a>?,” “is it in <a href="https://www.gwu.edu" target="_blank">D.C.</a>?,” “is it in <a href="http://www.wlu.edu" target="_blank">Virginia</a>?” or “why <a href="http://www.wustl.edu" target="_blank">St. Louis</a>?”</p>

	<p>Let the games begin.</p>
