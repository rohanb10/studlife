	<br><h4>(1) Fall 2015 WILD vs. (8) Allison Zastrow</h4>

	</div>

	<p> I’ll start this one with a fun story that makes me look uncultured and dumb (OK, but not as dumb as Wesley driving on the wrong side of the road). When I found out that <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/campus-events/2015/10/04/kygo-to-headline-fall-wild/" target="_blank"> Kygo was the WILD headliner</a> (a week before all you suckers, because #journalism), I can’t say I was stoked. Sure, I’d heard of him before, but literally that’s it. Anyway, on the day of, my roommate and I were getting ready to go and she decided to put some music on. When she started playing something I’d never heard, I turned to her and said, “This is actually really good. Who is this?” She deadpanned: “It’s Kygo, you idiot.”</p>

	<p> Now, <a href="http://www.studlife.com/sports/athlete-profile/2015/11/04/zastrows-offense-sets-up-wu-volleyball-for-success/" target="_blank"> Allison Zastrow.</a>

	Unlike Kygo, I’d never heard of her before. But like Kygo, I didn’t know any of her work. Apparently, she’s a volleyball player. Like a <a href="http://www.studlife.com/sports/womens-volleyball/2015/11/19/volleyball-setter-named-national-player-of-the-year/" target="_blank"> really, really good volleyball player</a>.<a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Believe it or not, it's not super easy to win the Division III volleyball player of the year."><sup class="sup-small"><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  But still, that’s all I know. </p>

	</div>

	<p> At the heart of all this lies the problem. I didn’t really know who either was, but I still went to WILD. There, I was surrounded by thousands of my peers (and this is only counting the ones who actually made it). Hypothetically, if I were to go see Zastrow in action, I might be lucky to see enough people to fill a Calculus II subsection. </p>

	<p>People care about WILD enough to show up. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/forum/staff-editorials/2014/02/03/wash-u-student-athletes-deserve-more-support/" target="_blank">Wash. U. sports? Not so much.</a> I have a really hard time not letting Zastrow win here because her accomplishments are impressive, but, at the end of the day, we’re trying to figure out who won and—at Wash. U.—it’s not our athletes. </p>

	<p>So, in the wise words of my roommate, it’s Kygo, you idiot. <em>– Noa Yadidi | Editor-in-Chief</em></p>

	<br><h4>(4) Lizzy Crist vs. (5) Alpha Delta Phi House</h4>

	<p><a href="http://www.studlife.com/sports/womens-soccer/2014/09/11/getting-to-know-new-womens-soccer-goalkeeper-lizzy-crist/" target="_blank">Lizzy Crist</a> won Division III <a href="http://www.studlife.com/sports/womens-soccer/2016/01/27/lizzy-crist-named-as-goalkeeper-of-the-year/" target="_blank">goalkeeper of the year</a>. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2016/02/04/alpha-delta-phi-approved-for-greek-housing-castlereigh-to-undergo-renovations/" target="_blank">Alpha Delta Phi was finally given a house</a>. Lizzy Crist tied a Wash. U. single-season record with 11 shutouts. Alpha Delt can now live on campus—not that they couldn’t before, but now they can do that and be together because that’s something dudes really enjoy doing. Lizzy Crist had five saves and four penalty kick stops against the top-ranked Messiah College in the Final Four and became a campus icon. Lizzy Crist is a boss. Lizzy Crist moves on. <em>– Wesley Jenkins</em></p>

	<br><h4>(3) Mozz Sticks vs. (6) Demetri Kavadas</h4>

	</div>

	<p>Oh to be a young freshman again, with a midnight mistake of a half-and-half looking you in the eyes, part chicken, part…fries? That’s right, earlier this year, Wash. U. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/residential-life-news-2/2015/08/24/dining-services-implements-new-eco-to-go-system-eliminates-mozzarella-sticks/" target="_blank">discontinued</a> the artery-stopping half of your Saturday night snack, leaving the campus in uproar. You may wonder why mozz sticks are even allowed in the bracket if they are no longer at Wash. U.? Well, some cruel god decided to give us mozz sticks <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/residential-life-news-2/2015/09/21/mozzarella-sticks-see-limited-return-after-petition/" target="_blank">one day a week.</a> It may have been a welcome attempt at appeasement, but no one can’t limit my bad health choices to just one day a week. </p>

	<p> The only thing that redeemed this egregious decision was the arrival of a man from the land up north—the University of Michigan, as some call it. Alright, <a href="http://www.studlife.com/cadenza/2015/09/14/the-boy-behind-the-backpack/" target="_blank">Demetri Kavadas</a> did not completely redeem the loss of mozz sticks, but his presence on campus has been felt since day one. With his “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” backpack and bevy of 70s and 80s hits blasting full volume, Kavadas has turned heads and brightened everyone’s days.</p>

	<p>For that, he moves on. But remember—whenever you think of your former weekend comfort—it is better to have loved and lost than to have never filled your mouth with glorious melted cheese that strings at just the right consistency. Mmm…what was I saying? <em>– Wesley Jenkins</em></p>

	<br><h4>(2) Loop Trolley vs. (7) Kenneth Sng</h4>
	<p>If I’m being honest, I can’t tell you much about Student Union. I only know who Jordan Finkelstein is because of that Yik Yak meme.</p>
	
	<div class="gif-container">
		<img class="brackets img-fluid" src="img/finkelstein.jpg" alt="finkelstein">
	</div>

	<p> If I’m being more honest, I get most of my political information from memes, but that’s beside the point. Every so often, I’ll hear a group of nerds yammering about SU transparency or advocacy or budget cuts, but I spend most of my time having anxiety about ordering from Holmes Lounge, so SU talk usually gets filed away in the sector of my brain where my memories of logarithms live.<a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Otherwise known as that one part of long-term memory from 'Inside Out' that Joy 'accidentally' destroys. There is no joy in logarithms."><sup class="sup-small"><strong>2</strong></sup></a> </p>

	<p> However, in a sea of “Futura”-ladden banners yelling at me to join Diversity Affairs Council, one man shines bright like a diamond: <a href="http://www.studlife.com/scene/profile/2016/04/20/a-portrait-of-kenneth-sng-student-union-failed-driver-tests-and-the-singapore-military/" target="_blank"> KENNETH F---ING SNG,</a> reigning Student Union president. It might be demeaning to call a grown man adorable, but god damn it, Kenneth f---ing Sng warms the cockles of my cold, dead heart. The first thing you notice about Kenneth is that he’s always smiling. As someone who hasn’t smiled since 1903, that’s something to believe in. Also, the dude’s campaign logo was a hug, for Christ’s sake. A HUG. Do you know any other politicians who ran on a platform of smiles and hugs? No, you don’t.<a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="George Bush might have, but it was also probably accidental."><sup class="sup-small"><strong>3</strong></sup></a> I’ve seen 14 episodes of “House of Cards,” so I can guarantee that this is a good thing. I’ve never personally met Kenneth, but I would trust him with my life, my heart and my LinkedIn profile—I have a feeling he has an “All-Star” account and is really generous about giving out endorsements. For all I know, Kenneth may be planning to launch a reign of terror and set the university on fire, but I’m graduating this month, so that’s y’all’s problem. I love you, Kenneth Sng, and I wish you all the best in your presidency.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/region/2015/04/13/new-loop-trolley-begins-construction-on-delmar-loop/" target="_blank">The Loop Trolley</a> and Kenneth Sng don’t have much in common, so it’s difficult to pit them against each other. For example, Kenneth is a kind, giving Wash. U. student, and the Loop Trolley is a fixed-route electric streetcar. I read “A Streetcar Named Desire” when I was in high school, and boy, let me tell you, that play isn’t very informative about public transportation. Since my formative streetcar information absorption years were wastefully spent yelling “STELLA!”<a class="no-underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1A0p0F_iH8" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="click on the annotation to see what I mean"><sup class="sup-small"><strong>4</strong></sup></a> and developing a fetish for men in sweaty white undershirts, I was not prepared for the havoc that the trolley has wreaked upon the whole of its 2.2-mile expanse. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2016/02/18/loop-trolley-construction-puts-strain-on-small-businesses-prompting-fight-for-survival/" target="_blank">Businesses in the crosshairs of the construction tanked,</a> traffic multiplied and I tripped over the tracks once and skinned my knee.</p>

	<p> The $51 million trolley is a historical homage to the streetcar that ran through St. Louis from the 20s into the 50s, but if AP U.S. History taught me anything, the last place you want to invest millions is in the 1930s. Kenneth moves on. <em>–Becca Christman | Staff Writer</em></p>

	<br><h4>(1) Presidential Debate vs. (8) Decreasing ThurtenE facades</h4>
	
	<p>You could make the argument that the <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2015/09/24/wu-to-host-second-presidential-debate-in-2016-2/" target="_blank">presidential debate</a> shouldn’t even be in this bracket because it’s not happening this year. You could make that argument. It would be wrong, but you could make it.</p>

	<p>You see, the debate itself may not be happening this year, but think of the fervor. Think of how much of this year has revolved around who will be coming to campus in the fall.</p>

	<p> Think about the <a href="http://www.studlife.com/forum/staff-columnists/2016/02/15/the-donald-more-than-just-fluff-contrary-to-his-hair-situation/" target="_blank">Donald</a>.</p>

	<p> The possibilities are too much.</p>

	<p>But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The presidential debate doesn’t even need its limitless possibilities to beat <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/campus-events/2016/04/11/thurtene-carnival-diversifies-attractions-focuses-on-st-louis-community-outreach/" target="_blank">ThurtenE</a> in this matchup—all it needs is Donald Trump.</p>

	<p>Just last month, chalkings supporting Trump appeared around campus and we collectively lost our s---. The simple physical existence of his name was enough to unsettle us. Imagine the man himself. The presidential debate holds the power to upend this campus at its core.</p>

	<br><h4>(4) Safety vs. (5) John Lewis</h4>
	<p> Let me start this entry off by making one thing inescapably clear—<a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2016/03/31/congressman-big-six-leader-john-lewis-to-deliver-155th-commencement-address/" target="_blank">John Lewis</a> is badass.</p>


	<p> Like, absurdly badass. Ludicrously badass. The kind of badass that everyone else, myself included, can only observe from a distance and marvel at the badassery which stands before us. The only living member of the Big Six? Badass. Fighting for racial equality in the House of Representatives since 1987? Badass. Continuing to do so all the way through to today, a full 29 years later, longer than pretty much any of us have been alive? Indescribably badass. And the fact that Washington University can bring in such a man to give our commencement address is, in and of itself, badass.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Sadly, Wash. U.’s student body isn’t quite as badass as John Lewis, and the average student’s reaction to the pick was a muffled “Why can’t we get Oprah?”—hardly a badass response. But, because this is Who Won Wash. U., the winner of this matchup is Safety, specifically the <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/student-union/2015/10/08/student-union-revamps-its-on-us-program-pledges-to-train-14-undergraduates-in-bystander-intervention/" target="_blank">It’s On Us initiative.</a> This initiative has changed things on campus for the better, raising awareness against campus sexual assault and making our campus a better place for us to be. Even if it isn’t quite as badass as John Lewis (it’s really, really hard to be that badass), It’s On Us is super f---ing badass, and there’s always more than enough badassery to go around. <em>– Sam Seekings | News Editor</em></p>

	<br><h4>(3) Uber vs. (6) SU vs. SPB</h4>
	<p>Just a few months ago, Wash. U. came the closest it has (or ever will) to an episode of the “Real Housewives of [insert place here]” when our student leaders decided to cancel the only reason I actually came to this school (R.I.P. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2016/02/01/fall-wild-likely-canceled-due-to-debate-logistics/" target="_blank">fall WILD 2016</a>). </p>

	<p>To be fair, Social Programming Board had an inkling the cancellation was coming. Student Union (allegedly) just didn’t give them a chance to make their plea. Even if their plea was, “Hey maybe we should ask the student body about this or give them a heads up that this might happen,” before they went completely <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/student-union/2016/02/08/su-spb-members-express-concern-about-wild-cancellation/" target="_blank">cold turkey</a>.</p>

	<p>See, SU has always had an issue with this thing they like to call “transparency.” Ask any member of SU what that means, and they’ll recite their entire candidate statement to you three years later. (Answer: they don’t know.) They’ve tried (see: budget manuals), but somehow the way our student government works is still a mystery to many. </p>

	<p>But THEN, SPB president Rahool Bhimani and <a href="http://www.avalle.org/" target="_blank"> SPB Treasurer Andres Avalle </a> answered all of our <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/student-union/2016/02/05/social-programming-board-criticizes-student-union-over-fall-wild-cancellation/" target="_blank">prayers</a>. They dropped the god damn mic. How did they do it? They picked up Merriam-Webster, called Mark Zuckerberg up to find out how the Facebook thing works and put the proverbial pen to the proverbial paper and went live with a scathing accusation of SU Exec’s missteps in announcing and shifting blame for the cancellation of WILD.</p>

	<p>Finally, someone figured out how that whole “transparency” thing worked—even if it took such drastic means to get there. Also, drama, when you’re not involved? Super fun to watch. For that, I say props to SPB for having a backbone.</p>

	<p> So, I almost forgot there was another side to this bracket. Let’s just clean it up real quick. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/forum/staff-editorials/2015/09/24/uber-breaks-monopoly-legitimizes-city/" target="_blank">Uber came to St. Louis</a>. Big whoop. Congrats, STL, for catching up to the rest of the country. Alright then, moving on.</p>

	<p>Decided whether you’re #TeamSU or #TeamSPB yet? It’s OK if not— it’s moving on, so just keep reading.<em>– Noa Yadidi</em></p>

	<br><h4>(2) East End Expansion vs. (7) Adjuncts</h4>
	<p>This matchup is actually pretty easy to call. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/faculty-news/2016/04/13/tentative-agreement-reached-between-adjuncts-and-wu-adjunct-walkout-now-victory-rally/" target="_blank">One literally won</a>. Following months of protests, organizing and meetings, the adjunct faculty at Washington University came to a tentative agreement last month. Was leadership happy with the agreement? I think so, given a walkout planned for the next day was replaced with a victory rally. </p>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/facilities-and-construction/2015/10/03/board-of-trustees-approves-plan-for-major-campus-expansion/" target="_blank">East End Expansion,</a> however, is just sort of a headache. It’ll be great once it’s done in 2019—with new buildings and “green spaces” and all that fun stuff on the other side of Brookings.</p>

	</div>


	<p> Maybe it’ll get past the first round in the 2019 bracket, but it won’t today. For now, it’s just displacing everyone. Examples include, but are not limited to: commencement and ThurtenE (also known as the two times per year students actually go down to the East End).</p>

	<p>I told you this one was easy. The adjuncts held a victory rally. You know who else has victory rallies? Winners. <em>– Noa Yadidi</em></p>
