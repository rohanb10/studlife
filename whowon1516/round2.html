	<br><h4>(1) Ruby Construction vs. (8) The Tab</h4>
	<p>Lucky for us Wash. U. students, we can always count on our trusty friends at <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2016/03/03/campus-media-organization-the-tab-arrives-at-wu/" target="_blank"> The Tab </a> as a source of both historical data<a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="From the last two months, of course">

</a> and unending entertainment. To the editors at The Tab, you are the reason why my relatives don’t understand we’re in St. Louis (You’re welcome for the free publicity, University of Washington). You are the reason I cry at night.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, we have the <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/residential-life-news/2016/02/08/new-residence-hall-to-join-umrath-house-first-year-center/" target="_blank"> new and supposedly improved Rubelmann </a> (Read: “Rubble”mann) Hall. 2015 marked the end of an era on the South 40 as we all wiped our tears and bid farewell <a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="For the second time—Ruby lingered, a bit like a piece of kale in your teeth after the power lunch that you tell yourself is good for you but really you just want a burger because you're an American and Americans eat beef for strong bones and large lovehandles.

	<p>While both were created to replace other Wash. U. institutions (Student Life may have been founded in 1878, but we are not past our prime, Tab), only one succeeded. Ruby—or should I say, Umrath House—wins based on the fact that it will be the shiny and new crown jewel of the South 40 for tour groups. “Yes,” the nervously laughing student tour guides will say, <a href="http://www.studlife.com/forum/staff-columnists/2014/09/04/why-you-should-love-your-traditional-dorm/" target="_blank"> “all dorms look like this.”</a> In the melodic words of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObzgUfCl28" target="_blank"> Kaiser Chiefs’, “Ruby,”</a> while you may not fill your beds, and your eternally-in-reverse construction equipment may wake me up every morning, you still win. <em>–Aidan Strassmann | Staff Writer</em></p>

	<br><h4> (4) CHERUB at the Pageant vs. (5) WUnderhouse </h4>
	<p> Fall WILD’s cancellation (and the ensuing SU vs. SPB showdown) was easily the biggest piece of drama to come out of this semester’s <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/student-union/2016/02/22/su-passes-budget-allocates-fall-wild-talent-budget-to-spring-adds-debate-programming-funds/" target="_blank"> SU budget allocation process</a>, but it wasn’t the only noteworthy development. First, there was WUnderground’s petition for around $1.4 million of SU block funding to be used toward purchasing an actual house in Clayton, Mo. Then, there was the more under-the-radar budget change that <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/campus-events/2016/03/23/cherub-to-play-spb-spring-concert-at-pageant/" target="_blank"> relocated SPB’s 2016 concerts from the Gargoyle to the Pageant</a>, the first of which would be headlined by <a href="http://www.studlife.com/cadenza/music/2016/04/18/offstage-an-interview-with-cherub/" target="_blank"> electro-indie duo CHERUB </a>. </p>

	</div>

	<p> As much as we love free concerts and “Doses & Mimosas,” the <a href="http://www.wunderground.wustl.edu/house/" target="_blank">WUnderhouse </a> wins this matchup hands down. </p>

	<p> WUnderground pokes fun at Wash. U. institutions every month through its satirical newspaper, but the publication’s jokes rarely take on lives of their own out in the real world. That’s why the WUnderhouse was such a welcome change of pace. Not only that, but the stunt was—as much as it pains me to say this about WUnderground—pretty sophisticated. <a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="As opposed to their other stunt, where they literally taped a member to the Underpass.">

The group did its research and followed all <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/student-union/2016/03/24/changes-to-su-budget-allocation-process-lead-to-increased-club-funding/" target="_blank"> SU block funding protocol </a>; you could tell an accounting major put some time into that complete line-by-line budget breakdown. And thanks to SU’s democratic budget allocation process, the only thing technically standing in the way of WUnderground getting a new home was 1,029 petition signatures and a two-thirds majority vote from the student body. It was an almost Stephen Colbert-esque, work-within-the-system-to-f----s---up kind of move. Did this elaborate joke make any sort of political point? No, not really. But was it amusing? Yeah, I think so.</p>

	<p>Things got a little too real when WUnderground briefly had more signatures on its block funding petition than S.A.R.A.H., the Sexual Assault and Rape Anonymous Helpline, but S.A.R.A.H. ultimately made it onto the ballot while the <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/student-union/2016/02/29/block-funding-petition-for-s-a-r-a-h-goes-to-vote-wunderground-petition-not-approved/" target="_blank"> WUnderhouse fell short </a>. With that, SU Treasury was able to breathe a collective sigh of relief, no longer facing the possibility of a nearly $1.4 million deficit. And while WUnderground may not have gotten its house, it did earn a little bit more of our respect in the process (and look: a StudLife feature!). <em>– Katharine Jaruzelski | Staff Writer </em></p>

	<br><h4> (3) Socioeconomic Diversity vs. (6) College Activism </h4>
	<p> So this is a conundrum. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/forum/2015/10/26/more-than-just-a-number-socioeconomic-diversity-by-name-and-story/" target="_blank"> Our University is absolutely horrible at promoting socioeconomic diversity</a>, evidenced by our paltry <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2015/10/26/schools-new-pell-plan-part-of-bigger-push/" target="_blank"> Pell Grant numbers</a>.</p>

	<p>We’re so bad at it that StudLife had an <a href="http://www.studlife.com/media/pdf/2015-2016/15-10-26.pdf" target="_blank">entire issue</a> dedicated to the various problems.</p>

	<p>In most matchups, that would be enough to win. But not this matchup. 2015-2016 nationwide has been characterized by student protests, calls for safe zones and general campus activism. While we have yet to make national media explicitly, Wash. U. has been a centerpiece of these debates, as anyone here could tell you. And you know what’s but a subset of a greater activist whole? Advocating for greater <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2016/04/28/proposal-to-create-space-for-low-income-students-combat-stigma/" target="_blank">socioeconomic diversity</a>.</p>

	<p>So, this matchup ends with a quick dismissal of the low-income applicant, something we should be used to after experiencing so many admissions processes. <em>–Wesley Jenkins</em></p>

	<br><h4> (2) Women’s Soccer vs. (7) Lori White </h4>
	<p> I know that in an earlier entry I said Wash. U. sports weren’t important enough to win a matchup. I lied. Soccer is different. Soccer isn’t just a sport—it’s a religion.

I realize that many of you will disagree with this sentiment, and that’s because you’re brainwashed Americans who somehow derive pleasure from watching grown men run into each other with all of their 400+ pound might.<a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Meanwhile, watching grown men avoiding running into each other, but pretending they did and were grievously injured by the 200 pound obstacle they avoided is much more entertaining.">

</a> Unfortunately for you, I’m in charge here.</p>

	<p> To the benefit of society and culture though, soccer’s image is rising in the United States. Interestingly enough (although I’m not complaining), it’s the women’s national team that’s more often in the spotlight. </p>

	<p> For instance, take the 2011 Women’s World Cup USA-Brazil quarterfinal game. Down 2-1 in the last minute of overtime, midfielder Megan Rapinoe (also known as God) gets the ball and—as she later describes it—just launches it from left midfield into the penalty box. Somehow, forward and legend Abby Wambach (also known as GOAT) gets her head on it and scores. I still get chills when I watch it.</p>

	</div>

	<p> Why am I going on and on about my favorite people who walk this Earth? Because it explains why hands down women’s soccer progresses in this matchup. </p>

	<p> See, lucky for us, we have our very own Rapinoe and Wambach, and their names are Lizzy Crist and Olivia Lillegraven (although Lillegraven is more of a Carli Lloyd and Crist is the keeper, but I digress). They too roam the halls of Olin Library, meet their friends at the bunny statue and try to navigate the perils of the housing process. As the tour guides remind us, student-athletes: they’re just like us! </p>

	<p> But the women’s soccer team is not. They are f---ing baller. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/sports/womens-soccer/2015/12/07/the-thrill-of-victory-the-agony-of-defeat/" target="_blank">They might have not won the Division III title this year, but they made it to the NATIONAL championships</a>. And how did they get there? They upset Messiah College.</p>

	<p> Going into the semifinal game Messiah was undefeated and had scored 100 goals that season alone—more than double the Bears’ 45. They’d also only allowed three goals in. </p>

	<p> To put it simply: they’re good. To put it even simpler: we beat them. </p>

	<p> Now, don’t get me wrong—<a href="http://www.studlife.com/scene/2015/09/14/meet-an-admin-dr-lori-s-white-new-vice-chancellor-of-students/" target="_blank">Vice Chancellor for Students Lori White</a> is also doing great things at the University in her first year. You might not be able to recognize her in person, but you’ve definitely seen her name come up in your email inbox. All. The. Time.</p>

	<p> But, still she hasn’t faced Messiah in penalty kicks. She hasn’t had the country’s second-leading scorer bolting towards her on a breakaway opportunity. She hasn’t been more than 100 minutes into the game of her life with blood, sweat and tears dripping down her Bears jersey. </p>

	<p> The women’s soccer team had a 20-3-1 record this year, for crying out loud. That’s an 87.5 percent win rate. They might not be “champions,” but you can’t dispute that they’re winners. Am I biased? Probably. Do I care? Not really. Remember, I’m in charge here. </p>

	<p> (Also, as a sidenote: I’m still mad at “Who Won” creator Rembert Browne for continually kicking Abby Wambach and/or the U.S. Women’s National Team out in the first round, and it’s time to fix that wrong. Go forth and prosper, women’s soccer.) <em> – Noa Yadidi</em></p><br>

	<p class="seattle text-xs-center"> “But why St. Louis?”</p> 
	<br><h4> (1) Spring 2016 WILD  vs. (8) Zach Alter </h4>
	<p> For years now, SPB has insisted that we students love electronic dance music and hip-hop. For years, this injustice has persisted, so unquestioned that even freshmen have been given the reigns. For years, we have been forced to listen to Scandinavian beeps and boops or drugged-out, short-circuited rap sets. And none of that is a bad thing. </p>

	<p> Yes, bringing the <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/campus-events/2016/03/29/all-american-rejects-to-headline-spring-wild/" target="_blank"> All-American Rejects for WILD</a> is notable in that SPB finally broke out of its complacent trend, but did anyone really want to return to their angsty teenage years? You screamed the words to three songs like you always do, cringed at all of the terrible between songs jokes and then stumbled home in a nostalgic haze that was just a bit too sticky and uncomfortable. In theory, AAR is a clear winner. On stage, meh.</p>

	<p> Freshman Zach Alter<a class="no-underline" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some people may claim that Zach is only in this bracket because I pledged an (unnamed) fraternity (composed entirely of DJs) with him this spring. Some people may say that I'm biased because of that. To them, I say: 'Can I take the minor you created?'; 'When will you be performing at the Pageant?'; 'Can I call 3LAU from your phone?'">

</a>, however, had been on Wash. U.’s campus for less than a full year before he changed the academic landscape by collaborating with a professor to create a new minor: <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/academics/2016/03/07/olin-business-school-to-offer-new-minor/" target="_blank"> the Business of Entertainment</a>. How many of you have instituted a new minor? Oh, you haven’t? And you’re a senior? Lame. </p>

	</div>

	<p> Zach Alter moves to the second round because he is embodying the future of this University now; AAR just drags us further into the past, and we all need to just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWD1vGy6SAA" target="_blank">move along</a>. <em> – Wesley Jenkins </em></p>

	<br><h4> (4) Rugby going D1 vs. (5) WU People’s History </h4>
	<p> Somehow I keep ending up with the entries that have something “sport” related to them. This time, we’re talking about rugby. I can’t say I know much about rugby. You know, rugby—that sport that’s kind of like soccer and kind of like football. Or you might’ve heard of it because you went to that one party they had last semester with all the big sweaty guys and no room to move? Yeah, thaaat rugby.</p>

	</div>

	<p> But, what impressive thing did they do that warrants them beating the likes of B.J. Novak and the Nemerov House car crash to make the bracket? They got promoted to <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2016/03/10/wu-club-rugby-team-set-to-move-to-division-i/" target="_blank">Division I</a>. (We’ll come back to this in a moment).</p>

	<p> What’s <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2015/09/10/wu-peoples-history-launches-discusses-marginalized-identities-secret-societies-2/" target="_blank"> WU People’s History</a>, you may ask (as everyone who saw me writing this did)? Well, to put it simply, it’s a <a href="http://www.wupeopleshistory.com/" target="_blank"> website</a> that went live in September launched by student activists to serve as a “disorientation guide.” The site includes essays on different topics including student activism, socioeconomic diversity and identity on campus. </p>

	<p> In theory, WU People’s History could have been big. I mean, it was for that first 10 minutes when people started sharing it on Facebook back in September. But that was it. It fell flat. I don’t really know why—and it looks like they even (finally) updated it since the fall—but given the topics the guide includes it doesn’t really seem to have done the service it was set out to do. </p>

	<p> So how does rugby beat it then? Sure, rugby may not be a varsity team, but rugby’s move is significant for two reasons. One: The ego of Contra—the frisbee team and another Division I team on campus (as they’ve so eagerly reminded us)—was marginally deflated. Two: We’re a little closer to Division I now! Closer to having a sports culture! Closer to being a Big Ten school! Closer to going to football games! </p>

	<p> Sort of? </p>
	<p> Kind of? </p>
	<p> Maybe? <em> – Noa Yadidi </em></p>

	<br><h4> (3) Women on Campus vs. (6) Sublime Literary Magazine </h4>
	<p> You may have seen the Women on Campus entry in the initial list of contenders or on the awesome bracket graphic and wondered to yourself, “What the hell does Women on Campus mean?” That is a fair question for you to have wondered and will be answered in this space so that you may understand why Women on Campus is so important. </p>

	<p> Women on Campus is a general bracket entry that encompasses all of the progress, notoriety, acceptance and standing women have gained on Wash. U.’s campus over the past year. This list includes but is not limited to the <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/academics/2015/11/04/women-gender-and-sexuality-studies-becomes-department/" target="_blank"> new Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies department</a>, the recognition of a lack of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/faculty-news/2016/01/28/physics-department-looks-to-add-female-faculty/" target="_blank">(STEM)</a>, the success of <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2015/11/09/own-it-holds-first-summit/" target="_blank">OWN IT</a>, bringing Bree Newsome, etc. It hasn’t been a world-shattering year in way of success, but it’s been progress, and that's enough to move on. </p>

	<p> We already have a <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2015/09/03/new-lit-mag-offers-creative-outlet-adds-competition-for-existing-spires/" target="_blank">literary magazine</a> on campus. Its name also starts with an ‘s.’ You can’t win if you can’t even beat your own competition. <em> – Wesley Jenkins </em></p>

	<br><h4>(2) Gamma Phi Beta vs. (7) Josh Whitman</h4>
	<p> So, by the rules laid out above, Josh Whitman shouldn’t even be in this bracket. But Josh Whitman made national news, so he has to be in the bracket. Welcome to the wild world of exceptions, everyone.</p>

	<p> I could say that this one is difficult, but that would be dishonest. It’d be even more dishonest than Josh Whitman saying that the position of Washington University athletic director was both “the chance of a lifetime” and “a destination job” <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2016/02/18/wash-u-ad-josh-whitman-hired-by-illinois/" target="_blank"> before unapologetically leaving fewer than two years later</a>. </p>

	<br><div class="text-xs-center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WashU: where the only thing going D1 is our athletic director.</p>&mdash; Fake Wrighton (@ChancellorW) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChancellorW/status/700495027961733120">February 19, 2016</a></blockquote>
	<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

	<br><p> But OK, we can briefly break this matchup down. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2016/02/11/gamma-phi-beta-extends-more-than-100-bids-continues-into-informal-recruitment/" target="_blank"> Gamma Phi Beta is an enigmatic sorority</a>—nobody truly knows who they are collectively, and whether or not they will be srat (or not) remains to be seen. They contribute something to Wash. U., even if we don’t know exactly what they are contributing.</p>

	<p>Josh Whitman, on the other hand, treated Wash. U. like a gaggle of Illini defensive linemen cocooned in a wet napkin. In his defense, St. Louis is kind of like a wet napkin, and nobody offered me a scholarship to play football at this school. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t bitter. Josh Whitman is like that ex who broke up with you kind of amicably, but you hate him anyway because he’s your ex, even though he didn’t really do anything wrong. But he actually did everything wrong by leaving you for Alice (who isn’t even that CUTE), so screw that guy. Josh Whitman sucks.</p>

	<p> Gamma Phi Beta sweeps this round. <em> – Sarah Hands | Senior Forum Editor </em></p>
