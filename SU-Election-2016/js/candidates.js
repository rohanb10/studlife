To quote John Lennon’s “Imagine” (a fantastic song which I would strongly recommend to all musical tastes), <em>You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us, and the world will be as one.</em>",

	description: "Student Union executives are often faced with challenging decisions that can have unpopular ramifications. I am prepared for this, and will ensure that Student Union maintains the highest standards for transparency during the decision-making process. One of the ways I will achieve this is by livestreaming and videotaping our Senate, Treasury, and General Budget Meetings. I also propose a public Student Union calendar that will enable students to know when and where Student Union meetings take place, so you can express your views. Finally, I will work with the next Executive Council to ensure that the student voice is given appropriate time and space during other meetings.
