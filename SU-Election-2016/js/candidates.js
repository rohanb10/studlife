	description: "Hi. My name is Demetri Kavadas, though most of you may know me as “Ninja Turtle Backpack Guy” or some variation thereof. Having transferred from the University of Michigan to Washington University this fall, I immediately fell in love with the campus and the students, faculty and staff that inhabit it. I very much feel apart of the WashU family and can only express my thanks to each of you for the wonderful sense of community you have helped create here. This being said, I am asking for the opportunity to further my gratitude by serving you in the Student Union. While I admittedly have no prior student government experience, I consider myself a hard worker who puts effort and passion into everything I do. Moreover, I listen better than I talk and thereby promise to bring such receptivity to SU as I strive to represent your interests in their purest form. My goal is unspecific: make Washington University even greater than it already is. Together we can further augment the currently wonderful community at WashU. To quote John Lennon’s “Imagine” (a fantastic song which I would strongly recommend to all musical tastes), “You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us, and the world will be as one.” Thank You, and I look forward to seeing you around campus.",
