	<p>I’ve been pulled over four times in my driving career. Of those four times, only one has resulted in a ticket, but that’s uninteresting because you’re supposed to get a ticket when you’re pulled over.</p>

	<p>The most recent time I was pulled over without getting a ticket, I was turning left onto Clayton Road by the AMC Esquire 7, and I cut the wheels a bit too early and ended up going the wrong way. Given that it was a Saturday night around midnight, I was pulled over immediately. Convinced I was driving drunk (I wasn’t, I’m just stupid), the policeman had me perform field-sobriety tests for half an hour before lecturing me and sending me on my merry way. Again, I’m just stupid.</p>

	<p>All of which to say, the Washington University school year spanning the years of 2015 and 2016 has felt a bit like driving the wrong way at midnight on a Saturday and then doing half an hour of Field Sobriety Tests while sober. Meaning: it’s been a clusterf---.</p>

	<p>From protests to mishaps, tiffs to full-on conflicts, no WILD to a presidential debate, this year has seen it all. That’s not to say there hasn’t been some good; it’s just been overshadowed by the massive pile of s--- that just keeps growing.</p>

	<p>Before the eternal shuttering of its digital doors, the esoteric sports and culture blog <a href="http://grantland.com" target="_blank">Grantland</a> produced a year-in-review bracket to determine “Who Won [insert year here]?” As most of our <a href="http://studlife.com/staff" target="_blank">staff</a> can be characterized as overzealous Grantland fanboys and girls, we decided to give it a shot.</p>

	<p>The rules are mostly the same—four categories, 32 contestants, one winner—but some tweaks had to be made. 1) We are all students with other lives to live so this bracket does not reflect one dicta—ahem—person’s opinion. Rather, it is a compilation of various staffers’ takes. 2) Rules are for <a href="https://facebook.com/noa.yadidi" target="_blank">losers</a>; we mostly made it up as we went.</p>

	<p>There are eight entrants from each of the four categories: a list that was narrowed down after a strenuous process consisting mostly of desperately trying to come up with 32 things that happened this year. But we did it. And here they are.</p>

	<div class="cat-list col-md-12">

	<p>Those are your categories. Take a long hard look because after this sentence, they are completely <a href=".." target="_blank">irrelevant.</a></p>
